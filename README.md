### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Exploratory Data Analysis over HappyDB
+ This project is conducted by Shaolong Lin

+ Project summary: An exploratory data analysis found out that the two most important factors people think most when asked about happiness are their family and friends. Surprisingly enough, there's no age, gender, and region different for that.
